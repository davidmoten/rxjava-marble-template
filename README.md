# rxjava-marble-template
Inkscape svg template mimicking rxjava style marble diagrams

Using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) (free open-source software available on Linux and other platforms), open this file:

```
marble-diagram.svg
```

and modify for your needs. Then export it as a PNG (Drawing only) and link to it with your documentation.

Example 
----------------
<img src="images/collectWhile.png?raw=true" />

Tips
-----------------
I'm no graphic artist that's for sure but there's lots of help on the web for stuff you might want to do in Inkscape.
